# Experiment 1 Contents

* analysis/:
    - figures/: Contains vectorized SVG files for the Experiment 1 figures included in the paper.
    - Analysis (IT-FDR2).ipynb: Pyhthon code for loading data from the experiment and generating the figures included in the paper.
    - Processing (IT-FDR2).ipynb: Python code for preprocessing the data, including calculating d' and C for each condition and organizing data from all sessions into a scores.csv file.
    - Screening (IT-FDR2).ipynb: Python code to detect and exclude participants who failed the headphone test or responded with a negative d'.
    - Stats (IT-FDR2).R: R code for all statistical analyses performed.
* data/:
    - Illusory*.csv: Tables containing all raw data for each individual participant, as recorded by Pavlovia. See README in data/ folder for full documentation.
    - excluded.txt: The list of participant IDs excluded by our screening methods. The list is saved as a text file with one ID number listed per line.
    - musical_training.csv: A table of data regarding participants' years of musical experience. Includes their years of formal instrumental training, their years of formal dance training, the number of years since they have taken formal instrumental or dance lessons, and whether they currently play an instrument (regardless of formal training).
    - scores.csv: A table containing all processed data, generated by Processing (IT-FDR2).ipynb. See README in data/ folder for full documentation.
* headphone_check/: Stimulus files for the headphone test of Woods et al., 2017 (<https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-017-1361-2>). The last three letters of each file name indicate which of the three tones is played In-phase, Out-of-phase, and Softer.
* plugins/: A folder for custom jsPsych plugins.
    - audio-multiple-response.js: A custom jsPsych plugin for presenting an audio file and recording multiple keyboard responses. Used for taking spontaneous motor tempo measurements.
* preparation/: Python code used for preparing the stimuli and trial schedules used in the experiment.
    - Tone Generation (IT-FDR2).ipynb: Code to 1) generate the raw tone files using librosa, and 2) arrange loudness-normalized tones into the stimulus sequence files found in sequences/. Loudness normalization was performed separately in Audacity.
    - Trial Randomization (IT-FDR2).ipynb: Code to pre-generate randomized trial orders, which are saved in schedules/.
* schedules/: JSON files containing pre-generated randomized trial orders. The experiment.js code loads session[ID].json as the trial schedule, where [ID] is the participant's ID number (assigned automatically by our pre-session questionnaire that was conducted on LimeSurvey).
* stimuli/: All wav files used as stimuli in the experiment.
    - tones/: Contains raw and loudness-normalized versions of each tone and click used in the experiment. Tones are labeled by their pitch class and octave, e.g. toneA3 is A3 (220 Hz).
    - sequence\_[task_type]\_[pitch]\_[tempo]\_[offset].wav: The stimulus sequence for trials of the specified task type, pitch, tempo, and percent timing offset. Task 0 is the pitched context condition and Task 1 is the pitched probe condition.
* experiment.js: The jsPsych code for running Experiment 1 on Pavlovia. Includes Pavlovia integration.
* index.html: The HTML code for running Experiment 1 on Pavlovia. Note that the jsPsych library sources are not included in this repository, as Pavlovia hosts their own copy of jsPsych that our HTML code automatically accessed.
