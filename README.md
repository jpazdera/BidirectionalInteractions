E1/ contains all stimuli, code, and data for Experiment 1, which was a timing discrimination experiment investigating whether pitch influences the perceived timing of auditory stimuli.

E2/ contains all stimuli, code, and data for Experiment 2, which was a pitch discrimination experiment investigating whether early/late timing influences the perceived pitch of auditory stimuli.

Both experiments were implemented in jsPsych and were run on <Pavlovia.org>. However, Experiment 1 was conducted remotely, whereas Experiment 2 was run in person through the browser of a lab computer.
